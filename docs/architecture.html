Architecture for Mutual Monitoring of Cloud Infrastructures</h1>
<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>The transparency of cloud infrastructures is a systemic challenge to
industry.</p>
<p>Internal or external stakeholders of a cloud infrastructure may want
to publish or verify data about its operational, resiliency, or security
properties. However, there are no specifications for common data
structures, protocols, or measurement algorithms to transparently
demonstrate evidence of those properties at once or over a time
interval. This document proposes an architecture that specializes
transparency service architecture for providers of cloud infrastructures
to publish evidence of security properties with verifiable digital
signatures. Providers of cloud infrastructures, their consumers, or
external auditors publish counter-signatures to verify multi-party
evaluation and verification of this evidence, known as a mutual
monitoring network.</p>
